# Adversarial Works in CVPR

This repository contains one-file-quick-summaries of works from CVPR which deal with 
adversarial attack or defense.
The list might be incomplete! In case you find a paper which I missed out, let me know! 

This post is linked to my blog post[], where draw the broad scope and direction of 
adversarial works in CVPR 2019, and also briefly introduce few of the interesting results from
CVPR 2019.

**Note**: The Adversarial works I am referring of here are related to robustness of deep neural
networks, i.e. Attacks and Defenses. This repository is not about Generative Adversarial Networks.
