# Summary of Adversarial Works

This repository contains one-file-quick-summaries of works from CVPR which deal with 
adversarial attack or defense.
The list might be incomplete! In case you find a paper which I missed out, let me know! 

This post is linked to my [blog post](https://medium.com/@Bardofcodes/adv-ac2c5a9bc639), where draw the broad scope and direction of 
adversarial works in CVPR 2019, and also briefly introduce few of the interesting results from
CVPR 2019.

# TODO:

1) Finish All `CVPR 2019` papers

2) Extend to a `gh-pages` website. 


**Note**: The Adversarial works I am referring of here are related to robustness of deep neural
networks, i.e. Attacks and Defenses. This repository is not about Generative Adversarial Networks.
